# DotProgress

DotProgress is a simple and somewhat hypnotic progress indicator. It's 2.2â€‰kb (gziped), customizable, and has no dependencies. [Demos](https://jiggmin.com/projects/dot-progress/examples.html)

## Simple Example

	//create a DotProgress instance
	var elm = document.getElementById('dot-holder')
	var dots = new DotProgress(elm)

	//set progress as things load
	dots.setProgress(.5)


## Using images

	//javascript
	var options = {
		activeDisplay: '',
		inactiveDisplay: '',
	}
	var elm = document.getElementById('dot-holder')
	var dots = new DotProgress(elm, options)
	dots.setProgress(.5)

	//css
	.dot-inactive {
		background: url('/img/dot-sprite.png')
		width: 12px
		height: 12px
	}

	.dot-active {
		background: url('/img/dot-sprite.png') -12px 0px
		width: 12px
		height: 12px
	}


## Methods
